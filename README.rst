pidlockfile: PID lock file module for use with python-daemon
============================================================

This module is a replacement for 'python-daemon' pidfile module.
TimeoutPIDLockFile class from pidfile implements "advisory" locking.
Essentially, it does not really lock anthing. It simply checks lock file
existence and, as a result, it can't detect certain situations like
server process crush and release the lock.

This module uses python's fcntl facility to lock the PID file. That
means that is if daemon process is terminated unexpectedly, lock is
automatically released and daemon can be restarted.

Installation
============

.. code:: shell

    pip install pidlockfile

Running unit tests
==================

From the project top level directory execute:

.. code:: shell

    python -m unittest discover -v
